My personal portfolio site hosted on Github Pages.

The goal of this site is to showcase my previous work, along with
my current skills. I aimed to make my portfolio as lightweight as 
possible, and adapted the layout from Freelance, an open-source template from <a href="https://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap.</a>
